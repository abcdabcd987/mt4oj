abstract = {This report describes and evaluates the implementation and applicability of an automatic programming assignment grading system we named the online judge. We compared this with the manual grading system that is currently being used and showed that the automatic grading system, when implemented carefully, is more convenient, fairer, and more secure than the former. We have successfully tested the system on two courses. However, further studies need to be conducted to improve the effectiveness of learning through this system. {\#}},
