abstract = {POJ ( Peking University Online Judge ) system is aiming at training the ACM/ICPC ( Association of Comuting Machinery/Intenational Collegiate Programming Contest) PKU team members. The system functions include user management, task library, realtime submission and judgement, discussion board, email system. It can he widely used in programming related courses in helping with the homework remarking and online examina-tion. In Peking University, POJ has been integrated in some courses such as 《Introduction to Computing》, 《C + + programming》, 《Data Structure and Algorithms》 and 《Problem solving and Programming》. Through POJ, the students may submit their homework at anytime and get prompt remark to their submisions. Professors can al-so watch the students behaviours on POJ and find out the most common problems with the students in learning. Taking exams on POJ makes the students try their best to improve their online programming techniques in stead of just remembering all the things. Meanwhile it is easier to find out similar programs so that less students copy their homework from others. POJ as a smart tool is a good helper in teaching programming.},

@article{Simard2017,
abstract = {The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for machine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible. While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of "learners", the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the "teachers". Machine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming languages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interaction and visualization. In this paper, we present our position regarding the discipline of machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also describe how, by decoupling knowledge about machine learning algorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models.},

abstract = {Forecasting models play a key role in money-making ventures in many different markets. Such models are of-ten trained on data from various sources, some of which may be untrustworthy. An actor in a given market may be incentivised to drive predictions in a certain direction to their own benefit. Prior analyses of intelligent adver-saries in a machine-learning context have focused on re-gression and classification. In this paper we address the non-iid setting of time series forecasting. We consider a forecaster, Bob, using a fixed, known model and a re-cursive forecasting method. An adversary, Alice, aims to pull Bob's forecasts toward her desired target series, and may exercise limited influence on the initial val-ues fed into Bob's model. We consider the class of lin-ear autoregressive models, and a flexible framework of encoding Alice's desires and constraints. We describe a method of calculating Alice's optimal attack that is computationally tractable, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness compared to random and greedy base-lines on synthetic and real-world time series data. We conclude by discussing defensive strategies in the face of Alice-like adversaries.},

In such attacks an attacker contaminates the training data so that a specific learning algorithm would produce a model profitable to the attacker. Understand-ing training-set attacks is important as more intelli-gent agents (e.g. spam filters and robots) are equipped with learning capability and can potentially be hacked via data they receive from the environment. This pa-per identifies the optimal training-set attack on a broad family of machine learners. First we show that opti-mal training-set attack can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. Then we show that for machine learners with certain Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions we can solve the bilevel problem efficiently using gra-dient methods on an implicit function. As examples, we demonstrate optimal training-set attacks on Support Vector Machines, logistic regression, and linear regres-sion with extensive experiments. Finally, we discuss po-tential defenses against such attacks.},

@article{Patil2014,
abstract = {Basic decisions, such as judging a person as a friend or foe, involve categorizing novel stimuli. Recent work finds that people's category judgments are guided by a small set of examples that are retrieved from memory at decision time. This limited and stochastic retrieval places limits on human performance for proba-bilistic classification decisions. In light of this capacity limitation, recent work finds that idealizing training items, such that the saliency of ambiguous cases is reduced, improves human performance on novel test items. One shortcoming of previous work in idealization is that category distributions were idealized in an ad hoc or heuristic fashion. In this contribution, we take a first principles approach to constructing idealized training sets. We apply a machine teaching procedure to a cognitive model that is either limited capacity (as humans are) or unlimited capacity (as most machine learning systems are). As predicted, we find that the machine teacher recommends idealized training sets. We also find that human learners perform best when training recommendations from the machine teacher are based on a limited-capacity model. As predicted, to the extent that the learning model used by the machine teacher conforms to the true nature of human learners, the recommendations of the machine teacher prove effective. Our results provide a normative basis (given capacity constraints) for idealization procedures and offer a novel selection procedure for models of human learning.},

She takes pleasure in the magnificent sentences of Philip Roth and the breathtaking paragraphs of Isaac Babel; she is moved by the brilliant characterization in George Eliot's Middlemarch. She looks to John Le Carre for how to advance plot through dialogue, to Flannery O'Connor for the cunning use of the telling detail, and to James Joyce and Katherine Mansfield for clever examples of how to employ gesture to create character. She cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which literature is crafted.},

@inproceedings{Rendle2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for ruining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},
