abstract = {This report describes and evaluates the implementation and applicability of an automatic programming assignment grading system we named the online judge. We compared this with the manual grading system that is currently being used and showed that the automatic grading system, when implemented carefully, is more convenient, fairer, and more secure than the former. We have successfully tested the system on two courses. However, further studies need to be conducted to improve the effectiveness of learning through this system. {\#}},

@article{Li2005,
abstract = {POJ ( Peking University Online Judge ) system is aiming at training the ACM/ICPC ( Association of Comuting Machinery/Intenational Collegiate Programming Contest) PKU team members. The system functions include user management, task library, realtime submission and judgement, discussion board, email system. It can he widely used in programming related courses in helping with the homework remarking and online examina-tion. In Peking University, POJ has been integrated in some courses such as 《Introduction to Computing》, 《C + + programming》, 《Data Structure and Algorithms》 and 《Problem solving and Programming》. Through POJ, the students may submit their homework at anytime and get prompt remark to their submisions. Professors can al-so watch the students behaviours on POJ and find out the most common problems with the students in learning. Taking exams on POJ makes the students try their best to improve their online programming techniques in stead of just remembering all the things. Meanwhile it is easier to find out similar programs so that less students copy their homework from others. POJ as a smart tool is a good helper in teaching programming.},
